# Analog Clock (HTML & CSS)

This project is a simple analog clock built using HTML and CSS only. The clock face displays numbers (1–12) in a circle, with hour, minute, and second hands rotating smoothly via CSS animations. No JavaScript is used — motion is powered entirely by CSS keyframes, with glowing effects and a dark, modern design.
