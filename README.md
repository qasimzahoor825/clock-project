# clock-project
This project is a simple analog clock built using HTML and CSS only. Numbers (1–12) are arranged in a circle, and the hour, minute, and second hands rotate smoothly using CSS animations. No JavaScript is used — motion comes entirely from CSS keyframes, with glowing effects, gradients, and a dark modern design.
